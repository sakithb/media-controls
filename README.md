Pull requests are welcome.

To update the translation files run `./mediacontrols.sh translations` in the extensions directory after your code changes are finished. This will update the files in po folder. Then poedit (https://poedit.net/download) can be used to translate the strings. poedit can also be used to create new localization files.
